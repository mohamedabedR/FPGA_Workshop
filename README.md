# Introduction To FPGA
  FPGA or a field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a designer . the FPGA configuration is specified by using a hardware description language (HDL) like (verilog ,etc.).
 the FPGA used in several firlds and application :
   - Hardware acceleration .
   - Signal processing .
   - Device controllers .
   - Embedded systems .
   - Aerosapce .
   - High performace computing .
   - Machine learning .
  FPGA Architeture .
